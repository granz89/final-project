				<p> My passion lies in design with my strongest focus being details and presentation. I strive to create the perfect package and this is where my appetite for graphic design came from. I use my skills from interior design and incorporate what I am learning in graphic design to be a versatile design professional. I have over 5 years experience in retail and design in a department store and a sustainable design firm. This has made me well versed in addressing customer needs and has refined my people skills. I am currently working towards completing an Advanced Diploma in graphic design at Algonquin College. I currently have a Bachelors Degree in Applied Arts specializing in interior design. </p>

 				<h3> Type Poster </h3>
			
				<p> The goal of this project was to create a poster to represent a font. The selected font for this work was Diavlo designed by Jos Buivenga. To create a poster that flected the font I incorporated a devil like feel that the typeface contained. To exaggerate the demonic sentiment devil horns were added to the uppercase A and a triangle to create a tail on the lowercase g. The horms were used by taking the descender off the upper case Q. </p>

 				<h3> Grimm Fairy Tale </h3>			
			
				<p> The Singing Bones is a Grimm fairy tale that I chose to create a 2 page spread for. In order to capture the feel of the story I created a green earthy background with organic brushes in the corners. I used music notes spreading out from different areas and manipulated the header front to look like human bones representing the death and revenge within the story. I used a serif font for legibility and a pull quote accented with bones to break up the text.</p>

 				<h3> Two Sided News Print </h3>
					
				<p> The two sided specification sheet was designed to provide insect information to school children that was easy to understand. It was design with the needs of children and teacher in mind. The layout uses colour to break up section headers and larger font to make it more readable for children. A photo was included to help the viewer visualize the insect, while I also used the blue colour to help brighten and give character to the page. </p>

 				<h3> Order Form Layout </h3>
					
				<p> The order form was a redesign of an existing Royal Distributing form. The original form was very overwhelming and distracting the new form was created to be minimalistic and easy for the user to follow. The new form uses clean tables and lines to separate sections, to make the form easier to follow. By eliminating all unnecessary text I was able to eliminate any confusion that could be caused while, also insuring that the key information would not be overlooked.  </p>

 				<h3> Logo Design </h3>
			
				<p> This logo was inspired by the tale of the pirate Long John Silver.  It was designed to be a less obvious representation of the typical pirate logo. The approach I took was to take the parrot, a popular character from the story, and bring in the pirate influence through its creation. I used apparel often found on pirates to do this. I also wanted a more creative background to the image, so I developed the common circle backing into a pirate ship wheel.</p>

 				<h3> Theather Poster </h3>			
			
				<p> The theater Poster was created for the play The Marie Curie Papers. The play is about the historic figure Marie Curie and the poster was designed to represent her story. The poster was to be eye catching and I did this by creating a large radiation symbol (Curie was known for her work with ration), making it a bright yellow and filling the symbol with images relevant to her story. The poster used hierarchy techniques lay all the information out.

 				<h3> Advertisement </h3>
					
				<p> Vitamix is a popular blender that this large-scale advertisement poster was created for. The poster used colour to engage the viewer and imagery to help the poster be clear from far distances.  The poster was created in Photoshop with different effects to help make the banner pop, from using drop shadows, to creating an appearance of the paper lifting from the poster. </p>

 				<h3> Magazine Cover </h3>
			
				<p> The goal of the magazine spread was to capture a strong portrait photo that could be used for a magazine cover. The project had us use the layout of and existing magazine cover. For my project I chose to use Nylon magazine, after learning about their brand I then photograph a model who would be a good representation of the company. Once the main photo was selected, it was edited and formatted with Adobe Photoshop.</p>

 				<h3> Food Photography </h3>			
			
				<p>  Baking and decorating sweets is a strong passion of mine. In order to combine my love of baking and design together I take artistic photos of my work. These cupcakes were made for two different clients both for Valentine’s Day celebrations. To maximize the quality of these photos I used strategic placing and lighting that would emphasis the food in the more engaging ways. </p>
